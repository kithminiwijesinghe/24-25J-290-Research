Speech Recognition and Pronunciation Scoring Model 

• Purpose: Assess how well children pronounce words and provide feedback. 

• Functionality:

o Converts spoken input into text. 

o Compares it with the expected pronunciation using similarity scoring techniques. 

o Gives feedback (e.g., "Try again!" or "Good job!"). 

• Suggested Model: Google Speech to-Text API, Mozilla Deep Speech, or Wav2Vec 2.0 (fine-tuned on dyslexia-friendly datasets).
